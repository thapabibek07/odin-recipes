    <h3><em>Instructions:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Season the beef (or lamb) with salt and pepper. Brown the meat in batches to avoid overcrowding. Once browned, remove it from the pot and set it aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics:
            <ul>
                <li>In the same pot, add another tablespoon of oil (or butter).</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Build the Stew:
            <ul>
                <li>Stir in the tomato paste and let it cook for 1-2 minutes to deepen its flavor.</li>
                <li>Return the browned meat to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the carrots, potatoes, parsnips, and celery. Stir everything together.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Add Liquids & Seasoning:
            <ul>
                <li>Pour in the beef broth and red wine (if using). Stir to combine, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the stew simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the vegetables are cooked through.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finish the Stew:
            <ul>
                <li>About 10 minutes before serving, stir in the peas and cook until tender.</li>

            </ul>
