    <h2>Viking Flatbread Recipe</h2>
    <h3><em>Ingredients:</em></h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour (or rye flour for authenticity)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil or melted butter (optional, for softer bread)</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: coarse sea salt, herbs, or seeds (e.g., caraway or sesame)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3><em>Instructions:</em></h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the Dough:
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add water, mixing with your hands or a spoon until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water; if too sticky, sprinkle in some more flour.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Knead:
            <ul>
                <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shape the Flatbreads:
            <ul>
                <li>Divide the dough into 6-8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then flatten into thin rounds (about 1/8-inch thick).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cook the Flatbreads:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a dry skillet or griddle over medium heat. Cook each flatbread for 2-3 minutes per side or until golden brown spots appear. If desired, brush lightly with olive oil or butter after cooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Serve warm with butter, cheese, or honey, or use them to scoop up Thor’s Hearty Stew!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
