This is a project that I am working on as part of my Full Stack Web Development from The Odin Project.
I will be using HTML entirely to work on this project for now.
I will be using various HTML tags and attributes that I have learnt so far and make a simple webpage which will have a Index page that will link to 3 different webpages containing recipes.
